The Siva Sutra of Panini
	<br><br>
Tradition believes that the 14 Siva Sutras - which are the building blocks of abbreviations in Panini' s Grammar -
		 were revealed to him by Lord Siva, hence the name.
<br><br>They are a catalog of phonemes, which are in essence the Devanagari alphabet (Varna-mala) reordered for 
	creating abbreviations.
	<br><br>
		Their sole purpose is to indicate a set of phonemes by the use of abbreviations -
		 technically called pratyahaara [प्रत्याहार] - involving only two phonemes.
		<br><br>
			The following are the fourteen Siva Sutras.

The Pratyahaaraa Technique:
<br><br>
The Siva Sutras consists of two kinds of elements:
<br><br>
(1) The phonemes like 'a', 'i' , 'u' etc - in BLUE Fonts above. If the phonemes are consonants the sound of 'a' will be appended to them for ease 
	of pronounciation(mukh-sukhartha) only, hence, 'ja' , 'ba' , 'ga' , 'Da' ... in Sutra # 10 not 'j' , 
	'b' , 'g' , 'D' , 'b'  etc.
	<br><br>
(2) The markers - called 'anubandhas'[अनुबन्ध] or 'it's[इत्] - shown in RED Fonts above
 always occur at the end of the list. Their role is merely indicatory and they 
are never included in the expanded form of the abbreviation.
<br><br>
The markers are always consonants and always bear the 'hala' sign'.
<br><br>
For example, in the First Sutra 'a', 'i', 'u', 'N' , the last element 'N' is a marker by virtue of its position. 
Similarly in Sutra # 4, 'ai', 'au' , 'c' , last element 'c' is a marker.
<br><br>
Decoding pratyahaaras:
<br><br>
A pratyahaara is an abbreviation always consisting of two phonemes, example: 'ak', 'jhal', 'jash'. 
(The 'a' in 'jhal' and 'jash' as explained above is only for ease of pronunciation)
<br><br>
If in Paninian Grammar we encounter a pratyahaar like ‘ik’ as in ‘iko guNa-vRRiddhi’ (1.1.3),
 we have to split it into two parts which will be in the present case ‘i’ and ‘k’.
<br><br>
Scan the fourteen Sutras and find ‘i’ amongst the non-marker phonemes. You will find ‘i’ in Sutra # 1.
<br><br>
Now look for the second constituent ‘k’ amongst the last member of all the sutras( i.e. the marker phonemes).
‘k’ will be found at the end of the second Sutra.
 Now we have successfully identified the upper and lower limit of pratyahaara ‘ik’.
<br><br>
Our next task is to produce elements which constitute ‘ik’.
In order to do so, start including all phonemes beginning with ‘i’ till ‘k’ and making sure to exclude the markers.
<br><br>
The set of phonemes thus extracted that constitute the pratyahara ‘ik’ would now be ‘i, ‘u’, ‘RRi’ and ‘LLi’.
<br><br>
Other Abbreviations:
<br><br>
‘sup’ and ‘ting’ group of affixes have also been used similarly to produce abbreviations which are actually only four,
 two from each group, ‘sup, ‘suT’, ‘ti~N’ and ‘ta~N’.
<br><br>
Besides these two, I have also added support for the uditas (abbreviations marked by small ‘u’ 
and given by Paninian Sutra ‘aNudita savarNasya capratyayaH’[1.1.69] ) ‘ku’, ‘cu’, ‘Tu’ ‘tu’ and ‘pu’ 
which each indicates the five phonemes of the five vargas respectively.
<br><br>
I want to include support for the ‘samanya-grahana’ abbreviations which consists of denoting a group of 
related affixes by using the syllable common to them. For instance, using ‘Ap’ to denote ‘Tap’, ‘cAp and ‘DAp’.
<br><br>
This at present I am unable to do as I do not have a complete list of these.
 If anyone comes across such a list he can contact me at my email address taddhita_priya@yahoo.com.
