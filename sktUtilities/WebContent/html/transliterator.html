<h3>About Devanagari-eLatin Transliterator</h3>

I had made this Devanagari Transliterator and Word Processor Software primarily to allow myself to type in Hindi and Sanskrit without going through the nightmare of learning a particular Hindi Font. This phonetic Word Processor is the perfect solution for my Devanagari Typing Needs and I am releasing it to the public in the hope that lakhs of Hindi and Sanskrit lovers who want to type in Devanagari but cannot will now be able to type using their knowledge of the Regular Roman Keyboards.
<br>
<br>
I hope to release Versions for All Major Brahmi-based Scripts of India and Abroad in the future.
